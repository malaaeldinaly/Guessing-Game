# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game implemented in C. The game allows you to guess a randomly chosen number between 0 and a maximum value that increases with each level. You have a limited number of tries to guess the correct number, and if you succeed, you move on to the next level with a higher maximum value.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in a C compiler or IDE.
2. The game will display your current level and a randomly chosen number within the range of 0 to the current level's maximum value.
3. Enter your guess for the chosen number.
4. You have a limited number of tries to guess correctly.
5. The program will inform you if your guess is too high or too low.
6. If you guess the correct number within the allowed tries, you advance to the next level with a higher maximum value.
7. If you exhaust all your tries without guessing the number correctly, the game will show the correct number and ask if you want to play the same level again or exit the game.

## Game Rules

- Each level increases the maximum value for the randomly chosen number.
- The number of tries you have is determined by the level you are playing.
- You win the level by correctly guessing the number within the allowed tries.
- You can choose to play the same level again or exit the game after completing a level.
